/******* PROBLEM SET TASK 
Your task is to create a program that advises a group of environmental scientists how to handle the growth and spread of a unique plant species under their supervision. You must develop a growth control
 
system that will monitor and predict the plant growth, making decisions based on the available space and potential growth.
